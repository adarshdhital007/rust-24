# Rust README (2024 goals)

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! ðŸš€ This README is like a storybook about my Rust journey. It'll keep growing as I learn more, adding new things I discover in the world of Rust. Throughout the year, I'll share my progress as I become proficient in Rust. ðŸ“–âœ¨

## Ownership

Ownership is one of Rust's most distinctive features. It allows Rust to achieve memory safety without a garbage collector.

### Ownership Rules

- **Each value in Rust has a variable that is its "owner."**
- **There can only be one owner at a time.**
- **When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.**

### Ownership Transfers

Ownership can be transferred using moves. When a value is assigned to another variable or passed as a function argument, ownership is transferred.

### Borrowing

Borrowing allows a function to take references to values without taking ownership. Borrowing can be mutable or immutable.

## Lifetimes

Lifetimes ensure that references in your code are valid. They prevent dangling references and contribute to Rust's memory safety.

### Understanding Lifetimes

Lifetimes are a way of expressing the scope during which references are valid. They are denoted by single-quote characters, like `'a`.

### Lifetime Annotations

In Rust, lifetime annotations are used to describe the relationship between the lifetimes of function parameters and return values.

### Lifetime Elision

Rust has lifetime elision rules that allow the omission of explicit lifetime annotations in many common cases, making code more concise.

### Lifetime Bounds

Lifetimes can be bounded to specific scopes using lifetime bounds, ensuring references are valid for a certain duration.

### Lifetimes in a Struct

 It helps to manage references and ensure memory safety. When it comes to structs, lifetimes can be used to define the scope of references held within the struct.
 
In Rust, lifetimes are used to ensure that references to data remain valid throughout their usage. A lifetime parameter is a name that represents the scope of a reference, indicating how long the reference is valid. This helps prevent dangling pointers, which occur when a reference points to data that has been freed or is no longer valid.

Think of lifetimes in Rust like expiration dates for references. Just as food isn't safe to eat after its expiration date, Rust references have lifetimes that decide how long they stay valid. Whether you explicitly state lifetimes or let the borrow checker figure it out, it's all about making sure references are used only when they should be. This keeps your program safe from memory problems and ensures it works correctly.

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}
```
